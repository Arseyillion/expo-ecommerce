/**
        THIS FILE EXISTS BECAUSE OF THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTION FROM THE NATIVEWIND DOCUMENTATION:

    If you're using TypeScript in your project, you'll need to set up the type definitions. Nativewind extends the React Native types via declaration merging. The simplest method to include the types is to create a new nativewind-env.d.ts file and add a triple-slash directive referencing the types
